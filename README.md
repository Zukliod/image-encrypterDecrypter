# Image Encrypter and Decrypter

This project contains two Python scripts, `encryption.py` and `decryption.py`, which allow you to encrypt and decrypt image files using the `cryptography` library.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts an image file using a secure key generated by the `cryptography` library.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts an encrypted image file using the saved key.

## Files

### 1. `encryption.py`
This script encrypts an image file using the `cryptography` library.

#### How it works:
1. Generates a secure encryption key using `Fernet.generate_key()`.
2. Saves the key to a file (`encryption_key.key`) for later use.
3. Prompts the user to input the path of the image file.
4. Reads the image file in binary mode.
5. Encrypts the image data using the generated key.
6. Writes the encrypted data back to the image file.

#### Usage:
```bash
python encryption.py
```

### 2. `decryption.py`
This script decrypts an encrypted image file using the saved key.

#### How it works:
1. Loads the encryption key from the `encryption_key.key` file.
2. Prompts the user to input the path of the encrypted image file.
3. Reads the encrypted image file in binary mode.
4. Decrypts the image data using the loaded key.
5. Writes the decrypted data back to the image file.

#### Usage:
```bash
python decryption.py
```

## Important Notes

- **Key Management**: The encryption key is saved to a file (`encryption_key.key`). Do not lose this file, as it is required for decryption.
- **File Overwriting**: The scripts overwrite the original image file with the encrypted or decrypted data. Make sure to back up your files before running the scripts.
- **Error Handling**: Both scripts include basic error handling to catch and display exceptions.

## Example

1. Encrypt an image:
   ```bash
   python encryption.py
   ```
   - Enter the path of the image file (e.g., `C:\path\to\image.jpg`).

2. Decrypt the image:
   ```bash
   python decryption.py
   ```
   - Enter the path of the encrypted image file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library (install using `pip install cryptography`)

## Disclaimer

This project uses the `cryptography` library for secure encryption. Ensure the encryption key is stored securely, as losing it will make decryption impossible.
